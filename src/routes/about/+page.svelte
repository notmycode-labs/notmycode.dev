	<h1>Who the hell are you</h1>
	<h3>Erm we are a group of software and hardware devs.</h3>
	<p>
		Founded on 2023-12-18 by <em>blueskychan_</em>, we mess around and break things more than
		<code>/dev/random</code> ever could.
	</p>
	<h2>Are we actually serious?</h2>
	<p>No. If it works, it works.</p>
	<h2>What can we do?</h2>
	<p>
		From bricked BIOS chips to building and patching kernels to creating unhittable networking
		setups think for yourself.
	</p>
	<h2>Can I join you?</h2>
	<p>Yes, if you can handle a mentally chaotic group of people and survive an insane interview.</p>
	<h2>Why?</h2>
	<p>Why not ask yourself why you even asked?</p>
	<h2>Your site sucks ass</h2>
	<p>Thanks</p>
